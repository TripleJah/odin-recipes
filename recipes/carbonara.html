    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti Carbonara, one of the most famous Pasta Recipes of Roman Cuisine, is made only with 5 simple ingredients: spaghetti seasoned with browned guanciale, black pepper, pecorino Romano and beaten eggs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>350 g (12 oz) of spaghetti</li>
            <li>200 g (7 oz) of guanciale</li>
            <li>4 whole medium eggs (1 egg each yeld)</li>
            <li>100 g (1 cup + 1 tablespoon) of grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, boil the water for the pasta while you prepare the carbonara sauce. Remember: 1 liter (4 cups) of water for every 100 g (3,50 oz) of pasta and 15 g (1 tablespoon) of coarse salt per liter (4 cups) of water.</li>
            <li>Cut the guanciale into small pieces (cubes, slices… as you prefer) then cook in a skillet over medium heat for about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir occasionally so that it cooks evenly. The more the guanciale cooks, the more its fat will melt and its meat will become crispy. </li>
            <li> Now prepare the pecorino cream. So, in a bowl put the eggs and pecorino Romano cheese. Use the whole egg, not only the egg yolk.</li>
            <li>Add some freshly ground black pepper. Then, mix quickly with a fork – or a hand whisk – until you have a creamy sauce.</li>
            <li>This egg and pecorino cheese sauce should be quite thick. Set it aside for the moment.</li>
            <li>The water should now be boiling so add the salt and cook the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Cook the spaghetti al dente, following the cooking time found on the pasta package.</li>
            <li> Using a spoon for spaghetti, drain the pasta when ready. Then place them in the skillet, over high heat, to season well with the guanciale.</li>
            <li>When the spaghetti and guanciale sizzle in the pan, TURN OFF THE HEAT, otherwise the eggs will overcook and you’ll end up with scrambled eggs and pasta!</li>
            <li>Authentic spaghetti carbonara is ready. So, with the help of a ladle and a fork, create a pasta nest and place it on a plate</li>
            <li> Add the guanciale (what’s left in the pan), freshly ground black pepper and grated pecorino romano to taste. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
